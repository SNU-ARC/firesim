# # Unique name for build farm.
# <NAME>:
#     # Class name of the build farm type.
#     # This can be determined from `deploy/buildtools/buildfarm.py`).
#     build_farm_type: <TYPE NAME>
#     args:
#         # Build farm arguments that are passed to the `BuildFarmHostDispatcher`
#         # object. Determined by looking at `parse_args` function of class.
#         <K/V pairs of args>

# Note: For large designs (ones that would fill a EC2.2xlarge/Xilinx VU9P)
# Vivado uses in excess of 32 GiB. Keep this in mind when selecting a
# non-default instance type.
